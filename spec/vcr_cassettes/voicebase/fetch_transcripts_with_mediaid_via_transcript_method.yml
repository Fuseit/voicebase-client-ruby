        00:00:08,88 --> 00:00:09,24
        Well into

        2
        00:00:09,25 --> 00:00:15,73
        a little bit more detail and we start with
        Mr geisha I'm just out with the renewables

        3
        00:00:15,74 --> 00:00:21,06
        and energy efficiency. And interest
        of time to see how we get on as

        4
        00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:27,97
        a renewables is actually the smaller part
        of AA. Exposure in this pocket so that

        5
        00:00:28,01 --> 00:00:29,56
        the funds I manage we have

        6
        00:00:30,11 --> 00:00:36,88
        a high single digit sentence you expose
        in this area. The first point to

        7
        00:00:36,89 --> 00:00:42,24
        note is that historically
        this is a sector that needed

        8
        00:00:42,25 --> 00:00:47,61
        a HUGE amounts of subsidy to cope with
        the very high technology cost that has

        9
        00:00:47,62 --> 00:00:54,49
        really transformed the last ten you
        know let's say ten years so that the

        10
        00:00:54,50 --> 00:00:59,96
        technology cost of substantially reduced
        solar has come down by around eighty

        11
        00:00:59,97 --> 00:01:06,34
        percent in the last seven years or so when
        has come down by around fifty percent

        12
        00:01:07,12 --> 00:01:13,97
        so. Looking around forty
        dollars megawatts how. Around

        13
        00:01:14,12 --> 00:01:20,67
        grid parity with conventional power
        there's gas yes I'm power stations for

        14
        00:01:20,68 --> 00:01:26,98
        example and that means you know that those
        are open for unsubsidized markets and

        15
        00:01:26,99 --> 00:01:32,65
        kind of growth going forward.
        It is an area that has

        16
        00:01:32,70 --> 00:01:38,67
        a lot of policy backing when you leave an
        energy targets for example so I think you

        17
        00:01:38,68 --> 00:01:45,63
        know the momentum is definitely there in
        you so terms of what we like and what we

        18
        00:01:45,64 --> 00:01:52,29
        don't line. We like geothermal power
        because as base load characteristics

        19
        00:01:53,18 --> 00:01:59,43
        we are invested in the dominant in that
        in that area both in terms of building in

        20
        00:01:59,44 --> 00:02:06,24
        a pricing projects and also selling the
        equipment power generation second area we

        21
        00:02:06,25 --> 00:02:12,68
        really like project developers this is
        utilities but these are the guys who are so

        22
        00:02:12,69 --> 00:02:18,23
        far looking projects taking it from scratch
        measuring the when you go through that

        23
        00:02:18,24 --> 00:02:23,53
        seeing taking the construction risks and
        creating this asset so we see the value

        24
        00:02:23,54 --> 00:02:30,24
        creation from that and also the defensive
        characteristics of the business that you

        25
        00:02:30,25 --> 00:02:36,93
        end up with. So we one of the substantial

        26
        00:02:37,58 --> 00:02:44,47
        renewable energy utilities in in that
        area. We don't like his things we're

        27
        00:02:44,48 --> 00:02:51,29
        less keen on so festal you pose these are
        and cities which exist to raise money

        28
        00:02:51,30 --> 00:02:56,78
        and buy pricing assets for
        the income we don't see

        29
        00:02:56,79 --> 00:03:03,28
        a loss of value creation from activity.
        And don't see why you wouldn't pay full

        30
        00:03:03,32 --> 00:03:06,42
        price for it safely. In

        31
        00:03:06,43 --> 00:03:11,31
        a world solved with
        income we just don't see

        32
        00:03:12,12 --> 00:03:17,43
        a lot of value in in those structures we'd
        rather in the developers who are selling

        33
        00:03:17,43 --> 00:03:24,38
        . Projects at our cost and.
        Second area we are caution of

        34
        00:03:24,42 --> 00:03:29,42
        course on is. We only have in
        the funds I manage probably

        35
        00:03:29,43 --> 00:03:32,77
        a couple of. The reasons
        the last is it's a bit of

        36
        00:03:32,78 --> 00:03:39,67
        a commodity market. So
        limited Barris went three.

        37
        00:03:40,71 --> 00:03:46,43
        Also no enduring business model that makes
        sense through the cycles as is pretty

        38
        00:03:46,44 --> 00:03:50,87
        volatile and not an area that
        we have lots of exposure.
